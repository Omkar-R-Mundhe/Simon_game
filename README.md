# Simon Game 🎵🎮

A fun and interactive Simon game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with audio feedback to enhance user engagement.

## Project Overview 📋
The Simon game is a memory challenge where players must replicate an increasingly complex sequence of colors and sounds. With each successful level, the sequence grows longer, testing the player's memory and reaction time.

---

## Features ✨
- **Dynamic Game Logic**: Randomly generates a sequence of colors for each level.
- **User Interaction**: Players click buttons to replicate the sequence.
- **Audio Feedback**: Each button press triggers a unique sound.
- **Visual Feedback**: Buttons flash to indicate the correct sequence.
- **Game Over Animation**: Displays a visual and audio indication when the user makes a mistake.
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on different screen sizes.

---

## Technologies Used 🛠️
- **HTML**: Structure of the game.
- **CSS**: Styling for an engaging and visually appealing interface.
- **JavaScript**: Core game logic and interactivity.
- **jQuery**: Simplified DOM manipulation and event handling.

## How to Play 🕹️
1. Open the game in your browser.
2. Press any keyboard key to start the game.
3. Watch the sequence of button flashes and sounds.
4. Click the buttons in the same order as the sequence.
5. If your input matches the sequence, the game progresses to the next level with an additional step in the sequence.
6. If your input is incorrect, the game ends, and you can restart.

## Folder Structure 📂
- **index.html**: The main HTML file containing the game's structure.
- **css/styles.css**: Styling for the game's interface.
- **js/game.js**: JavaScript file for the game logic.
- **sounds**: A folder containing the audio files (`red.mp3`, `blue.mp3`, `green.mp3`, `yellow.mp3`, `wrong.mp3`).

## Audio Integration 🎵
The game uses sound files to provide audio feedback. Each button corresponds to a unique sound:
- **Red Button**: Plays `red.mp3`.
- **Blue Button**: Plays `blue.mp3`.
- **Green Button**: Plays `green.mp3`.
- **Yellow Button**: Plays `yellow.mp3`.
- **Game Over**: Plays `wrong.mp3`.
